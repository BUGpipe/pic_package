## Guessing Game

### Question1

**The probability of winning a game is 1%.**

### Question2

**Add the breakpoint at line 50, then in the debug window you can see the value of the selected_number, which is generated by function computer_pick_number(). Then you can choose the exactly same number to win the game.**

### Question3

**Yes, you can use the debugging feature only to make user to win every game by guessing "42". The thing you should do is to right click the selected_number in the panel, while you are in the debug window(set the breakpoint at line 50), then choose the "set value" to set the value of the selected_number to 42.**
